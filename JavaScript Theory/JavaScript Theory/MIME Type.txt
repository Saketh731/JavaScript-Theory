A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type)
It indicates the nature and format of a document, file
***Important: Browsers use the MIME type, not the file extension, to determine how to process a URL, 
              so it's important that web servers send the correct MIME type in the response's Content-Type header.

Syntax: type/subtype

Ex: For the MIME type text, the subtype might be plain (plain text), html (HTML source code), or calendar
