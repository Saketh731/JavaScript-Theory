Response headers from server has
-------------------------------
content-encoding: br(Brotli)/gzip/deflate/compress/identit


Request headers at browser has
------------------------------
accept-encoding: br,gzip,deflate

***NOTE: When a browser requests a resource, it will use the Accept-Encoding HTTP request header to indicate what compression algorithms it supports
	 Your server should return the Content-Encoding HTTP response header to indicate what compression algorithm it used.

If there are any uncompressed files those are shown in the Opportunities section of Lighthouse
Lighthouse calculates the potential saving by compressing the uncompressed files using Gzip and does not show the 
uncompressed file in opertunity tab if the potential saving is less than 10% of the original size



Check if a response was compressed in Chrome DevTools 
-----------------------------------------------------
You can check it in network tab by clicking the type of file you want to check it for. And the looking in the Headers tab.	

To compare the compressed and de-compressed sizes of a response:
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can check that in the network tab by enabling large request rows. In the size section you can see that. Top size is compressed, bottom is de-compressed.
