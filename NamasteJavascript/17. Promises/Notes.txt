Promise are nothing but objects.
Lets say you called an API - createOrders(carts), which takes time to fetch data
Initially it will return a promise {data: undefined}. after the fetch is completed, it will return {data: [{...}]}

Once the promise object gets the actual data, it will call the callback function inside its 'then' (promise object will have a then method in it). Something like below:
const promise = createOrders(carts);
promise.then(function (orderId){
    proceedWithPayments(orderId);
})
// This callback function will be called once the promise receives the actual response from the createOrders() API

Previously we used to do it like below

createorders(cart, function (orderId){
    proceedWithPayments(orderId);
})

**This is not the right approach as we as passing the callback the proceedWithPayments function (ganding it over) to another function and loosing the control.
**But in promises we are atatching the callback function to a promise object. That is why we will have control here. Once our promise object is filled the orderId data, promise will automatically call (responsible to call) the callback function (unlike previously where createorders function is responsible to call our callback functoin). It will callit 100% and called only once, so we have no tension, it is handled by Javascript

The real Promise
.................
fetch
    fetch is a browser web API and it by default return a promise
    fetch has three 2 main properties
        1. PromiseState (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
        2. PromiseResult (undefined, Response)

const promise = createOrders(carts);
promise.then(function (orderId){
    proceedWithPayments(orderId);
})

((or))

This PromiseResult ypu will get it as a param in callback function in then(), like:
createOrders(carts).then(function (orderId){
    proceedWithPayments(orderId);
})

**Note: Promises are special Javascript objects and they are immutable. You cannot change/mutate a promise object

Interview Definition of Promise: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion (from pending to fulfilled) of an async operation

Promise Chaining
................
Chaining all .then will grow the code vertically and will not lead to something like callback

Problems solved
...............
Inversion of Control
    - This problem has solved because now you are not giving control to anyone to execute your callback function, but you have the control here
Callback hell
    - To resolve this we do promise chaining where our code will not grow horizontally like callback hell but will go vertically


Summary of learning
...................
First we saw how to do async calls using callback. But there are 2 major problems with callback - 1. Inversion of Control 2. Callback hell.
We solved it using promise object which we get from fetch() call and this promise object will be eventually filled with result of async operation (in the callback functoin in .then) and we dont need to pass the callback to any function, instead attach it to the promise object (precisely to .then). Whenever we get the data from async operatio, this callback function will be automatically called by promises by injected response data in it.





Crisp Notes
...........
Promise are nothing but objects => {data: undefined / [{}], then: ()=>{}, catch: ()=>{}}
Interview Definition => A promise is an object representing the eventual completion (from pending to fulfilled) of an async operation
When you call fetch api (createOrders(carts)) it return a promise object => {data: undefined}. After getting response =>  {data: [{}]}
Once you get the data, callback which is sent as an argument to 'then' will be called internally (only once). 'then' is a property of promise object.
Previously:
createorders(cart, function (orderId){ // Giving control to createorders to call the callback function & proceedWithPayments
    proceedWithPayments(orderId);
})
Now:
const promise = createOrders(carts);
promise.then(function (orderId){ // We have the control over here. It will call it 100% and called only once
    proceedWithPayments(orderId);
})

Fetch => fetch has 2 main properties in its returned Promise object. console.log(fetch(..)) => {[[PromiseState]], [[PromiseResult]]}
        1. PromiseState (pending, fulfilled, rejected)
        2. PromiseResult (undefined, Response)

fetch().then((response)=>{ // The result is sent as an argument to the callback function of 'then'. (browser does this by default)
    return response.json(); // This is to deserialize the data
}).then((result)=>{
    console.log(result);
})

Promise Chaining => .then will grow the code vertically and will not lead to something like callback hell

createOrders(carts).then(function (orderId){
    return proceedWithPayments(orderId);
}).then(function (paymentInfo){
    return showOrderSummary(paymentInfo);
}).then(function (balance){
    return updateWalletBalance(balance);
)
