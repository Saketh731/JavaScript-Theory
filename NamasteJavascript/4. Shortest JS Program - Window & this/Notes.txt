The shortest Javascript program is just an empty file.
Even for an empty context you can see a Global context is created. 

Window
    - Whe you see JS Engine created a Global context for you, it also attaches a global object called 'window' to that context.
      Whatever you declare in global scope (outside of all functions) it will be attached to winodw object.
      Ex: var x = 10;
          function a(){var y = 100}
          console.log(x); //10
          console.log(window.x); //10
    
this 
    - Along with window object, another object called this will also be created for each execution context. If it is a function context, then 'this' will be pointed to that function context. 
      If it is a global context, then 'this' will be pointed to Global context that is 'window' object


Crisp Notes
...........
Shortest Javascript program is just an empty file. Even empty file has Global context
JS engine attaches 'window' object to Global context. Ex: var x = 10; window.x //10
Also JS engine attaches 'this' object for each execution context.  If it is a global context, then 'this' will be pointed to Global context that is 'window' object
