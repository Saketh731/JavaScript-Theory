Event Bubbling - That means Bubble up (That means, when you click on Child, first Child click event gets called and then after Parent click event gets called)
Event Capturing is also knows as Event Trickling - That means Trickling down (That means, when you click on Child, first Parent click event gets called and then after Child click event gets called)


Netscape used to do Even Capturing in their browsers
Microsoft used to do Event Bubbling in their browsers as they feel Bubbling makes more sense

So W3 has come in and set standards for all the browsers to follow. That is, in any event both Event Capturing and Event Bubbling will happen in a cycle.
That is, first Event Capturing happens and then Event Bubbling happens next. It is the responsibility of the developer to mention which one he wants to utilize by mentioning true/false as a third param in addEventListener()

Example: .addEventListener('click',()=>{}, useCapture) //useCapture is either true/false like - .addEventListener('click',()=>{}, true).
         // If you dont mention anything as third arguemnt (useCapture), by default it will treat it as false, that is, as Event Bubbling

e.stopPropagation()
    If you want to stop any event to not propagate down or up (capture/bubble), then set e.stopPropagation() at that specific event callback. 
    If you set  e.stopPropagation() while the useCapture is false for that event then it stops the Event bubbling to next parent event, else if useCapture is true then it stop the Event Capturing to next child event
