Even let and const are hoisted, that means they are also allocated memory first, before even the code execution starts.

Script scope
    At the memory created phase they are assigned a value of unidefined just like var, but they are kept in 'Script' scope (under Script) as undefined till some value is assigned to it 

 Global Scope   
    But the var variables are kept in Global scope under Global

One the let and const are assigned a value (execution reaches that line)  then the undefined is replaced with the value under Script scope

Temporal Dead Zone
    - From the time it was assigned undefined in Script scope (Hoisting) to the time it is initialized and assigned an actual value is called the Temporal Dead Zone


Note: You cannot access let & const variables in window object. You will get undefined as they are not part of Global scope (for browser global scope means window)

You get Reference error if you try to access let/const variable before initialization
You get Syntax error if you try to redeclare let variable like let a = 1; let a = 10; (For syntax error JS wont even execute single line of code, it just rejects it and throws error)
But for var you do do redeclaration - var a = 1; var a = 10; 

Const 
    Const variables are same as let but you cannot reassign a value to them

Const a;
a=10;
// You will get Systax error saying you 'Missing initializer in Const declaration'
**Note: When using const, you need to initialize them at the time of declaration only

Const a =10;
a=10;
// You will get Type error saying you 'Assignment to const variable not possible'

You const as much as you can, and then let and var should be least/none
Declare all variables at top to minimize Temporal Dead Zone to 0

Reference error: When you are trying to access a variable in memory and not able to access (it can be let/const or variable not present)
Systax error:When errors in syntax (like declaring let twice, not initializing const while declaring...)
Type error: When reassigning a value to const (Typical type errors) 



Crisp Notes
...........
var, let, const -> all are hoisted (i.e var assigned with undefined)
var - Global scope | let, const - Script scope
Temporal Dead Zone - From the time let/const assigned memory to the time it is assigned an actual vaule (execution reaches that line)
let/const cannot be accessed with 'window' object -> undefined as not part of Global scope
Reference error - If you try to access let/const variable before initialization (When unable to access a variable IN MEMORY)
Syntax error - If you redeclare let variable like let a = 1; let a = 10; (But for var this works)
               If you miss initialization for const. Ex: const x;
Type error - Const a =10; a=20; You will get this Type error - "Assignment to const variable not possible"

var - function scope [Can be redeclared and updated]
      var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope. And will be initialized to undefined if not assigned any value
let - block scope [Can be updated but not redeclared]
      let variables are also hoisted to the top of their scope, But will not be intitalized with undefined.
const - block scope [Cannot be redeclared and updated, NOTE: But the attributes inside const object can be updated]
        const variables are also hoisted to the top of their scope, But will not be intitalized with undefined.
        NOTE: Will get reference ERROR if tried to access before it is initialized.
