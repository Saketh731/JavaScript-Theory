Crisp Notes
...........
Function within setTimeout forms a closure with parent lexical environment. When ever setTimeout is executed after a certain time then it still holds the parent scope variables as they are stored in the Closure.
Constructor Function: 
  function Counter(){
    var x = 2;
    this.increment = ()=>{
        x++;
        console.log(x);
    }
  }
  var counterFunc = new Counter();  // **Note: If you do it like "new counter()" you will get Type Error. Always use Capital Letter at first for Constructor Functions
  counterFunc.increment(); // 3
