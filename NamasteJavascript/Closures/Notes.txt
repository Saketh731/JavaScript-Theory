Closure is a function that is bind together with its Lexical Environment.
That is, Function along with its Lexical Scope forms a Closure

If you have below Example
function a(){
    let x = 10;
    return function b(){
        console.log(b);
    }
}

let p = a();
p(); // 10

10 is still printent even though execution context of 'a' and its variabl is removed from stack. This is because function b retains its lexical/parant scope by storing the variables of its parent under 'Closure' scope
