Both Debouncing and Throttling are used to optimize performance by decreasing the number of times an API is called on an event

Debouncing 
..........
This will call the API when it exceeds the given delay (time) between 2 events. So it is called immediatley when the delay time exceeds. (That is after the setTimeout completes the time)

Throttling
..........
This will call the API in an interval. Like if we have given a time interval of 3 seconds (But not setIntervel exactly..it uses setTimeout only). It will make an API call every 3 seconds, but the catch is if there is no click (or any) event after 3 seconds it waits for the event and then after the event occurs (even after 100s) then only it will make API call


Example1: When searching in a search bar. Debouncing is a better option
Example2: When resizing a window, if you want to track how many times the window is resized then debouncing is better. But throttling is the better option to do any action after every 500ms
Example3: When clicking a button for a shooting game, throttling is the better option to do any action after every 500ms
