Both Debouncing and Throttling are used to optimize performance by decreasing the number of times an API is called on an event

Debouncing 
..........
This will call the API when it exceeds the given delay (time) between 2 events. So it is called immediatley when the delay time exceeds. (That is after the setTimeout completes the time)

Throttling
..........
This will call the API in an interval. Like if we have given a time interval of 3 seconds. The it will make an API call every 3 seconds irrespective of the events getting triggerd


Example1: When searching in a search bar. Debouncing is a better option
Example2: When resizing a window, if you want to track how many times the window is resized then debouncing is better. But if you want to track the frequency of resizing then throttling is better
Example3: When clicking a button for a shooting game, throttling is the better option to control the number of firings
