Hoisting is able to access Javascript variables and function even befre they got initialized, that is, even before the execution line reaches them

If you access any var varibales lets say (var x) even before its initialization, it will print as undefined (If var x itself s not there then it will give error saying 'x Not defined')
Similarly if you try to access any function declaration  even before its initialization, it will print the entire function

This happens because in Javascript, even before the actual execution first a Memory (Variable Environment) is created where these undefined and function code is assigned

Note for function expressions if declared with var, it works Similarly lika var variable

Note: Javascript is loosely typed language. That means, once you define var x = 10; You can again reassign it to different type like x = "Hello", which you cannot do in other strongly typed languages
